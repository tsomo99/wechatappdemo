The following is a simple WeChat applet example, which is used to help users practice Tibetan typing. The page displays a Tibetan string. The user needs to enter the corresponding Tibetan characters and submit. The system will determine whether the input is correct.

Function description:
The page displays a predefined Tibetan string (for example: བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལེགས).
The user enters the corresponding Tibetan string in the input box.
Click the Submit button, and the program will determine whether the user input is the same as the displayed string.
According to the input result, the page will display a prompt of "Input correct" or "Input wrong".

Extended functions:
Random string generation: You can use multiple Tibetan sentences and randomly display one at a time for users to practice.
Timer: Provide users with a time-limited typing challenge to increase fun.
History: Record the user's typing results, and count the accuracy and speed.
This applet can help users become proficient in Tibetan typing through simple input and judgment logic, and can also further expand more functions.
